## Welcome to the home of PHYLACINE, a global database for late Quaternary mammals.

PHYLACINE is a database that features:
- Trait data (mass, diet, life habit)
- Island endemicity
- IUCN threat status
- Phylogenetic trees
- Current ranges
- Counterfactual present natural ranges
  
  ...for all extant and recently extinct mammal species.

### Download the data
To download the archival version of PHYLACINE (Version 1.2.0) or to read our detailed metadata, vist our page on [DataDryad](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bp26v20).

To see the latest version of PHYLACINE (Version 1.2.1), check out our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MegaPast2Future/PHYLACINE_1.2).

<br><br>

### Try out the data
We have some example [code](https://github.com/MegaPast2Future/PHYLACINE_1.2#vignette) at our GitHub site to help you easily create a map and phylogeny of Australian megafauna.

Also, please cite the underlying large datasets that were used to make PHYLACINE. Details on these datasets and their respective citations can be found in the PHYLACINE 1.2 metadata.

If you would like high resolution copies of the PHYLACINE logo for your presentations, we have both a [colored version](PHYLACINE_logo_large.png) and a [black and white version](PHYLACINE_logo_large_bw.png) that you may use.

### Report errors
If you have an error to report or a suggestion to improve the database, please contact us through this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeo0vEbt7IO6DV0FXLt8wzgXVXEcw2lYHzJeItbA_CiM-PjSw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

<br><br>

### Check out our Most Wanted List
You can also help us out by taking a look at our [Most Wanted List](https://github.com/MegaPast2Future/PHYLACINE_1.2/blob/master/docs/Most_wanted_list.csv) of species with missing data. Recognize any names and know where we could find data about their diet or body mass? Please drop us a [line](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeo0vEbt7IO6DV0FXLt8wzgXVXEcw2lYHzJeItbA_CiM-PjSw/viewform?usp=sf_link). Species with large ranges and imprecise phylogenetic imputations are ranked highest.
