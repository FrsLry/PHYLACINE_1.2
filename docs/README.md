## Welcome to the home of PHYLACINE, a global database for late Quaternary mammals.

PHYLACINE is a database that features:
- Trait data (mass, diet, life habit)
- Island endemicity
- IUCN threat status
- Phylogenetic trees
- Current ranges
- Counterfactual present natural ranges
  
  ...for all extant and recently extinct mammal species.

<br><br>

### Download the data
To download the latest stable version of PHYLACINE (Version 1.2.0) or to read our detailed metadata, vist our archive on [DataDryad](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bp26v20).
<br><br>
<br><br>

### Try out the data
We have some example [code](https://github.com/MegaPast2Future/PHYLACINE_1.2#vignette) at our GitHub site to help you easily create a map and phylogeny of Australian megafauna. 
<br><br>
<br><br>

### Cite the data
To cite PHYLACINE, please use the following:
>Faurby, S., Davis, M., Pedersen, R. Ã˜., Schowanek, S. D., Antonelli, A., & Svenning, J.C. (In Press). PHYLACINE 1.2: The Phylogenetic Atlas of Mammal Macroecology. Ecology.

If you would like high resolution copies of the PHYLACINE logo for your presentations, we have both a [colored version](PHYLACINE_logo_large.png) and a [black and white version](PHYLACINE_logo_large_bw.png) that you may use.

### Report errors
If you have an error to report or a suggestion to improve the database, please contact us through this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeo0vEbt7IO6DV0FXLt8wzgXVXEcw2lYHzJeItbA_CiM-PjSw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

<br><br>

### Check out our Most Wanted List
You can also help us out by taking a look at our [Most Wanted List](https://github.com/MegaPast2Future/PHYLACINE_1.2/blob/master/docs/Most_wanted_list.csv) of species with missing data. Recognize any names and know where we could find data about their diet or body mass? Please drop us a [line](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeo0vEbt7IO6DV0FXLt8wzgXVXEcw2lYHzJeItbA_CiM-PjSw/viewform?usp=sf_link). Species with large ranges and imprecise phylogenetic imputations are ranked highest.
